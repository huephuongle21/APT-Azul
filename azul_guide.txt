=== AZUL GUIDE ===

= SEED CHOICE =
When launching AZUL, if you wish to provide a seed, specify it in the command line arguments.

For example, you could use the command: './main -s 10' to specify a seed of 10.

If no seed is provided, a random seed will be generated for use in new games.

When loading games, the seed specified in the load file will be used.

= LOADING GAMES =

To load a game, launch AZUL, choose option '2', and specify the path of the save file you wish to load.

Our save format is templated in manually_generated_saves/save_template_empty.txt

= PLAYING AZUL =

To take a turn, use the following command structure:
'turn [factory choice] [colour choice] [pattern line choice]'

For example, to take all red tiles from factory 1, and place them in pattern line 3, type:
'turn 1 R 3'

= SAVE GAME =

To save the current state of the game, use the following command structure:
`save [save path]`

For example, to save the game as 'my_save.txt', type:
`save my_save.txt`

= EXITING GAME =

To end the game without saving, either type 'quit', or hold `ctrl+D`.

= HELPING =

To query what command to use, enter 'help'.
